# 🐔 Bird & Chicken Classifier
Built with Teachable Machine + TensorFlow.js

A fun and smart image classification web app that can detect birds, and more impressively, distinguish chicken in all forms — live chickens, raw meat, and even cooked chicken (like fried or roasted). Whether it's a bird in the wild or a chicken nugget, this model knows it’s chicken.
